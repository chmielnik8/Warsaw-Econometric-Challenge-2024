We took part in a 24-hour challenge to analyse data on vaccination on COVID-19. The aim was to provide a research paper that answered the following questions:

1. does the size of municipalities/cities matter?
2. do we see a division between eastern and western Poland? Consider i.a. the partitions or Vistula river as borders?
3. Do we see variation in vaccination rates among different age groups?
4. What makes us best in class? Approach this question in the context of big cities, small cities and rural areas.
5. Are there any links between vaccination rate and political views?
6. is there a neighbourhood effect? Is the propensity to vaccinate contagious?

We have gained experience in preparing and processing data, combining datasets and creating graphs.
